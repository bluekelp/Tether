Tether
------

A minecraft server plugin for CraftBukkit.

A stupid proof of concept plugin to tether a player to a point in the world.
When activated, the user will be teleported back to the anchor if s/he wanders too far from it.

commands:
```
    /tether <length>
```

will tether you do your current position. the optional length arguments is the number of blocks you can stray before being yanked back to your original position. defaults to **3** blocks.

```
    /untether
```

untethers you and you're free to roam around again
